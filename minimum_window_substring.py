# MINIMUM WINDOW SUBSTRING
# Given two strings s and t, return the shortest substring of s 
# such that every character in t, including duplicates, is present 
# in the substring. If such a substring does not exist, return an empty string "".
# Example: s = "OUZODYXAZV", t = "XYZ"

# Time Complexity: O(n + len(t)) 
# Space Complexity: O(u), where u is the number of unique characters in t
